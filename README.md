# DSA in Swift

Over the next few days, I will be revisiting my Data Structures and Algorithms concepts while implementing them in Swift. Stay tuned as I share my daily progress and insights here, day by day.

## Day 1 


### Topics Covered:
1. Arrays
2. Dictionary
3. Linked List

#### Summary :

1. Array
	- Swift defines array using protocols.(Sequence,Collection,RandomAccessCollection)
	- Appeding take O(1) while inserting at a particular place takes O(n).

2. Dictionary
	- Dictionaries don't have any guarantees of order , nor can insert at specific index.
	- Main key protocol is hashable apart from collection and etc.
	- Inseting and retrival are of O(1).

3. Linked List
